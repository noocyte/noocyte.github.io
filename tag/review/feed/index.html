				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, I <a href="http://noocyte.wordpress.com/2008/01/24/new-phone-sonyericsson-w910i/">promised</a> a review of Media Manager once I&#8217;d used it for awhile. That would be now. So, here we go. </p>
<h3>Installation and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-Of-Box_Experience">OOBE</a>&nbsp;<img style="border-width:0;margin:0 0 0 25px;" height="38" alt="4" src="http://noocyte.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/4.gif" width="39" border="0"> </h3>
<p>I <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/support/products/softwaredownloads/w910i?cc=no&amp;lc=en">downloaded the installation</a> file and ran it. But soon enough I was told that I needed to download and install some other tings first; QuickTime and Microsoft C++ lib&#8217;s. That was handled more or less automatically for me, so no <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=biggie">biggie</a> there. Actually it was pretty smooth sailing for me, but you mileage might very.</p>
<p>The rest of the installation was simple enough, a few questions and no real hassle. On Vista you of course have to permit it (you are using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control">UAC</a>, yes?) and of it goes. Grab a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuppa">cuppa</a>, cause it&#8217;ll take a few minutes to complete. </p>
<p>All in all not a bad OOBE, I&#8217;d rate it to 4 out of 6. </p>
<h3>In use <img style="border-width:0;margin:0 0 0 25px;" height="39" alt="3" src="http://noocyte.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/3.gif" width="41" border="0"> </h3>
<p>Basically what I wanted to do was;</p>
<ol>
<li>Subscribe to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">podcasts</a> and transfer them to <a href="http://noocyte.wordpress.com/2008/01/24/new-phone-sonyericsson-w910i/">my phone</a>
<li>Transfer some of my music to my phone
<li>That&#8217;s it!</li>
</ol>
<p>So my demands for the software are pretty low and I won&#8217;t be living inside Media Manager.</p>
<p><a href="http://noocyte.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/interface.png"><img style="border-width:0;" height="404" alt="interface" src="http://noocyte.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/interface-thumb.png" width="644" border="0"></a> </p>
<p>Let me start with saying that Media Manager is slow. It&#8217;s slow to start, slow to transfer stuff and slow to react. I won&#8217;t blame it for slow transfer speeds, but I&#8217;m tempted&#8230; It really is a hog! At startup it requires 85 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte">MB</a> and during transfers/sync it requires up to 150 MB (observed). However the interface, as seen above, it simple (as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a> simple) and easy enough to understand. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s boring and non-inspiring, but that&#8217;s subjective. As can be seen in the picture I&#8217;ve subscribed to a number of podcasts and they&#8217;re downloaded and transferred to my phone without me having to take any action, other than connecting the phone via USB and starting Media Manager.</p>
<p>There are a few settings, such as default music format (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">MP3</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding">AAC</a>) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitrate">bitrate</a>. Nothing fancy, but in keeping with the rest of the software &#8211; Simple. I rather like it, few settings to mess with and few choices to make. As long as it does the job I&#8217;m okay with it. But I really have to make it clear; the performance side sucks. Big time. It really is slow and very unresponsive at times. It feels like a bad coded Java program from 2001. And that, my friends, is not good. I feel really bad, because the software is a .Net program! There is no reason for it to be this slow! I think the programmers at SonyEricsson need a performance course! And they need to learn how to use threads! It looks like everything is happening on the GUI thread&#8230; Not good! But this is just version 1.1, so I hope it&#8217;ll improve as time goes by. </p>
<p>And it&#8217;s translated into quite a few languages! That&#8217;s nice. I&#8217;m using the Norwegian version and the translation isn&#8217;t half bad, even though I&#8217;ve found a few mistakes here and there. Nothing major though. But I have not found a good way to communicate with the developers, which is sad. </p>
<p>In summary I&#8217;m gonna give it a 3 out of 6 here, mostly because of terrible performance.</p>
<h3>Conclusion<img style="border-width:0;margin:0 0 0 25px;" height="39" alt="3" src="http://noocyte.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/31.gif" width="41" border="0"> </h3>
<p>The program does what I need it to do, but nothing more really. It&#8217;s no replacement for Windows Media Player or iTunes, that&#8217;s for sure. But it handles podcasts fairly well and you can transfer music to your phone without jumping through too many hoops. So it&#8217;s OK. Nothing more. For a more comprehensive review please read <a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com">All about Symbian&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/reviews/item/Sony_Ericsson_W960_SE_Music_Manager.php">review</a>. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give it a 3 out of 6 in total score. It lacks in performance to score 4 and lacks a lot to score any higher. Please SonyEricsson; open up and communicate with your users. Look at Microsoft, they&#8217;re opening up and improving big time! Seriously.</p>
