				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The other day I noticed that I got an error message when trying to read my blog. Basically it said that the database connection was not behaving and WordPress was unable to load my blog. Auch I thought and started to wonder what could be wrong. The thing is, I run this blog on <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/web-sites/">Microsoft Windows Azure Web Sites</a>, using the WordPress application from their gallery. I have done very little to set it up, apart from the custom domain name. The blog was running on <a href="http://noocyte.azurewebsites.net/">http://noocyte.azurewebsites.net/</a> and I setup a CNAME record to point to <a href="http://blog.noocyte.net/">http://blog.noocyte.net/</a>. All fun and games, until the database broke down… </p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit; the database is mySQL and is running in Azure, but it’s operated by ClearDB, not Microsoft. And <a href="https://www.cleardb.com/home.view">ClearDB</a> has no integration with the regular Azure control panel. In fact I am still unaware of how to manage my database…</p>
<p>Anyway I went into the Azure portal and had a look at my blog web site; all peachy! The database is listed as a linked resource and all lights were green. So I googled with Bing and came up with <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/ssdsgetstarted/thread/a2fe0bd6-7e46-4350-af00-158b296d8dfd">one decent answer</a>; the load on the database could be exceeding the allowed load by ClearDB. But how on earth this blog could attain such a load was a mystery to me… So I <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsazurewebsitespreview/thread/a9a02261-85e1-4f87-97dd-cf08e9e58548">posted a question</a> of my own on MSDN Forums and fairly soon a representative from Microsoft came back to me suggesting that I contact ClearDB and making them ‘adjust’ the database connections limit. So I filled out <a href="https://www.cleardb.com/contact.html">their form</a> and waited. In fact I waited 4 days and heard nothing. On Monday I tweeted:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.noocyte.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tweet1.png"><img title="tweet1" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="tweet1" src="http://blog.noocyte.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tweet1_thumb.png" width="640" height="182"></a></p>
<p>They came back to me and suggested I fill out their contact form again, which I did. This time they came back within the hour and told me that my database had been “de-provisioned by a call that was made from Windows Azure on Thursday, January 10th at 15:21 UTC”! De-provisioned means deleted in my book; not cool! </p>
<p>Long story short, they were able to restore the database into a new database and everything was OK. They are now investigating why this de-provisioning call was made, I sure as heck didn’t make it! And the database is still listed as a linked resource in the Azure portal! </p>
<p>As a side note; since the blog was down anyway and I had to create a new database I finally created my own subscription in Azure, separate from my work subscriptions, to host the blog. Will cost me a bit of money, but feels good to pay for services I use!</p>
