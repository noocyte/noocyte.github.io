				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So up until today I have only heard, read and watched Git happen. I have not yet actually tried it. So when I realized today that I actually had some spare time I thought I would dig into it and see if I could understand the hype and perhaps find it useful!</p>
<p>My very first step was to find a good tutorial on how to get started. I found one on <a href="http://www.seascapewebdesign.com/blog/getting-started-git-windows">Seascape Web</a> that I found easy to follow and short enough so that I didn’t get lost. In the end I managed to setup <a href="https://github.com/noocyte/Util.DoubleKeyDictionary">my repo</a> and commit my <a href="http://blog.noocyte.net/2008/02/18/double-key-dictionary/">Double Key Dictionary</a> source code (more on this later).</p>
<p>The next step will be to work with the code and Git to see how that feels vs. <a href="https://tfs.visualstudio.com/">Team Foundation Service</a> that I’ve been using so far.</p>
