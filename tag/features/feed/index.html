				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pretty cool! I like the fact that they (Microsoft) are actually showing us their specs! That&#8217;s just awesome! Charles asked for feedback on whether we wanted to see more spec like this or not; my answer is a simple yes. It&#8217;s awesome to see how Microsoft does this and to see what you guys are thinking. How will VSTS/TFS look/feel/act in the near future? All good stuff!</p>
<p>As for the features; The bug submission feature doesn&#8217;t really attract me all that much, but it looks like a nice feature though. The linking spec was just too much for me, I lost track after like 3 minutes of reading. Looking forward to a new drop of Rosario CTPs to test though. The e-mail feature looks nice, especially when paired with TSWA. Not sure how I feel about the requirement to use Outlook though&#8230; Could this be done in a more open fashion? </p>
<p>Something just dawned on me; why aren&#8217;t WI queries available as RSS feeds? That would be an awesome feature!</p>
