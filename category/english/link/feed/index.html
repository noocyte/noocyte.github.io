				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This looks interesting! I’ll have to follow the next n parts of this! </p>
<blockquote><p>This system started small but gradually had increased demands in the form of new features clients wanted added. Pretty soon, when you clicked the save button multiple things were happening; a database row would be updated, an email would be sent, a new file would be written, another status file would be updated. These were all executed when the user clicked the button, therefore every action was a blocking action, the server couldn&#8217;t move on until it was done servicing that particular request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#777777">The quote above is from the blog post and sort of sums up my experience with a CMS-like application (Synergi), where we once did a Save, Send Mail, Commit we ended up with something like this after a few years; Save, Mail, Mail, Mail, Update Table X, Update Table Y, Mail, Commit. So a solution, like the one proposed in the blog post, could work very well for Synergi. Interesting.</font></p>
